# Pixel Creator

A small, dependency-free pixel art editor that runs from a single folder of
static files. Pick a grid size, pick a colour, fill in cells, export a PNG with
a transparent background.

## Running it

Open `index.html` in a browser, or serve the folder:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4321
```

Then visit http://localhost:4321.

## What it does

- **Canvas size** — any grid from 1×1 up to 128×128, plus 8/16/32/64 presets.
  Resizing keeps the pixels that still fit inside the new bounds.
- **Palette** — 16 starter colours, a colour picker, and *Add* to put a custom
  colour into the palette.
- **Tools** — pencil (`B`), eraser (`E`), flood fill (`G`), eyedropper (`I`).
- **Undo / redo** — `Cmd/Ctrl+Z` and `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Z`. A whole drag counts as
  one step.
- **Export** — PNG at 1×, 8×, 16× or 32× the grid. Cells you never touch are
  written as fully transparent pixels, and the export is drawn fresh rather
  than captured from the screen, so neither the grid lines nor the
  transparency checkerboard end up in the file.

## Layout

| File | What's in it |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html` | Markup for the panel and the canvas |
| `styles.css` | All styling |
| `app.js` | The editor: model, rendering, input, history, export |
